<h1>Bike Sales Customer Analysis</h1>


<h3>Project Overview:</h3>
This analysis aims to understand the relationship between customer income and bike purchase decisions. We'll explore whether income levels influence buying habits and if there are other factors at play. Additionally, we'll examine how commuting distance affects sales and determine the typical commuting range for bike purchasers. This information will help us assess whether our current price points are appropriate for potential customers who haven't yet made a purchase.

<h3>Data Preparation:</h3>
1. Created a working copy of the dataset to preserve the integrity of the raw data.<br>
2. Conducted thorough data cleaning, including:<br>
   - Removing duplicate entries<br>
   - Standardizing data formats<br>
   - Correcting or removing invalid values<br>
   - Eliminating irrelevant information<br>
3. Developed pivot tables to facilitate visualization and analysis.

<h3>Analysis Process:</h3>
1. Utilized pivot tables to compare average income levels between bike purchasers and non-purchasers.<br>
2. Identified key characteristics of our target customer base.<br>
3. Created a comprehensive dashboard featuring relevant information to support data-driven decision-making.<br>

<h3>Challenges and Solutions:</h3>
During the creation of one chart, we noticed that commute distance values were not in ascending order, and an outlier was skewing the results. To address this, we revisited the working dataset and carefully reformatted the commute distance values. This process required testing various formatting options to find the most suitable solution without disrupting existing pivot tables and charts.

<h3>Conclusion:</h3>
The dashboard reveals two key insights:<br>
1. Customers with higher incomes are more likely to purchase a bike.<br>
2. There is an inverse relationship between commute distance and bike purchases, with customers who have shorter commutes being more inclined to buy.<br>
<br>
These findings will help inform our marketing strategies and product offerings moving forward.
